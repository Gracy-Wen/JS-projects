        <div class="T2 invisible">you took it home and decide to give it a name. what will you call it? (it's a he/male/boy)</div>
        <div class="T3 invisible">yay! he love it so much that he started jumping up and down. because of that, now he's hungry.</div>
        <div class="T4 invisible"> you looked around your house, but found no food because you're broke. at last, you borrowed those two things from your wonderful neighbor:</div>
        <div class="T51 invisible">you chose to feed him white chocolate, but he think it'a too sweet so he got mad and start scratching your sofa. what should you do?</div>
        <div class="T52 invisible">you chose to feed him dark chocolate, but he think it'a too bitter so he got mad and start scratching your sofa. what should you do?</div>

        <div class="T91 invisible">he think you're a useless human who can't even find him a girlfriend (and maybe that's the reason you're single) so he slapped you with his tail and left. GAME OVER</div>
        <div class="T92 invisible">he love that cat sooooo much! he thinks you're a wonderful human and wants to pay you back, so he found a girlfriend for you, and then you four live happily ever after. THE END</div>
